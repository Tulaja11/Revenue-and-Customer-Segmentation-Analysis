# Revenue & Customer Segmentation Analysis

## About the Project
This project analyzes online retail sales data to understand:

- How much revenue the business is making
- Which customers spend the most
- Which customers purchase repeatedly
- Which countries generate the most revenue

## The goal is to use SQL and Python to find useful business insights from raw data.

# Tools Used

- MySQL – to store data and run queries
- SQL – for analysis (revenue, customers, trends)
- Python (Pandas) – to read data from MySQL and analyze it further
- MySQL Workbench & Jupyter Notebook

## What I Analyzed Using SQL
- Total revenue of the business
- Top customers by total spending
- Customers who made repeat purchases
- Revenue generated by each country

##  Python Usage
- Connected MySQL to Python using SQLAlchemy
- Loaded SQL query results into Pandas DataFrames
- Verified and explored results using Python

## Key Insights
- A small number of customers generate a large share of revenue
- Repeat customers are important for business growth
- Some countries contribute much more revenue than others
- Customer segmentation helps identify high-value customers
